Began coding interface
appJar imported and finished the layout for initial form, main form and add transaction form
Code varies from given pseudocode, due to limitations of appjar. It is not possible to have each form held within its own function as I had hoped. This is because there can only be one gui instance running at a time, and subwindows must be created from that.
Designs differ slightly to those given in Analysis and Design document, again due to limitations of appjar

Finished coding of interface for rest of buttons excluding the chart generator. Some changes needed to design again:
Edit form cannot have same widget names as Add form, so have had to rename some
File selection and both new and existing save form use standard windows select and save dialogs rather than custom ones
Only non-functional buttons now are "Toggle Currency" and "Generate Pie Chart" ones, as these will require more library imports, and further complications
Downloaded MySQL Module for python to begin database work
Got database manipulation working: Create database, create table, insert to table, modify insert and fetch data for display
Added row to entity model in Design for data types
